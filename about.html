            <h1 class="w3-text-white" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; text-indent: 2em;">    
                MomSQL is born from a deeply personal mission: to empower children with skills that will shape their future. As a mother of two young boys, aged 6 and 8, Iâ€™ve watched 
                their boundless curiosity and wondered how to channel it into something lasting, something that gives them the confidence to explore, create, and grow.

            <h1 class="w3-text-white" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; text-indent: 2em;">   
                As a professional with a background in accounting, business analytics, and artificial intelligence, and years of experience teaching and mentoring, Iâ€™ve seen the 
            transformative power of learning. I know what it means to equip someone with tools that open doors to possibilities they hadnâ€™t imagined. But as a parent, I also 
            understand the magic of seeing a childâ€™s eyes light up when they discover their own potential.

            <h1 class="w3-text-white" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; text-indent: 2em;">   
                MomSQL brings these two worlds together. Itâ€™s a bridge between my professional expertise and my passion for nurturing young minds. I hold an MBA in Business Intelligence 
            and Analytics and a Graduate Certificate in AI, and Iâ€™ve worked on projects that tackle data, programming, and problem-solving. Yet my proudest achievement is creating a 
            platform designed to make coding accessible, exciting, and empowering for children. MomSQL is more than just a websiteâ€”itâ€™s a tool for sparking curiosity, building confidence,
             and inspiring the next generation of thinkers and innovators.
